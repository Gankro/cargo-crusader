# Cargo Crusader

Hark, Rust crate author! The battle for Rust's reputation as *The Most
Reliable Software Platform Ever* is here, and nobody is free of
responsibility. The future of Rust, dear Rustilian, is in your hands.

Join the **Cargo Crusade** and bring the [Theory of Responsible API
Evolution][evo] to the non-believers.

Cargo Crusader is a tool to help crate authors evaluate the impact of
future API changes on downstream users of that crate before they are
published to [crates.io].
