# Cargo Crusader

Hark, Rust crate author! The battle for Rust's reputation as The Most
Reliable Software Platform Ever is here, and nobody is free of
responsibility. You! Dear Rustacean are responsible for the future of
Rust.

Join the Cargo Crusade and bring the [Theory of Responsible API
Evolution][evo] to the non-believers.

Cargo Crusader is a tool to help crate authors evaluate the impact of
future API changes on downstream users of that crate before they are
published to [crates.io].
